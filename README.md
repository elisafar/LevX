# 🌟 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Theory and Applications 🌟

## 📌 Overview
This project dives deep into the fascinating concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, blending clear theoretical explanations with hands-on applications. Presented in my style, this approach offers a rare and unique perspective, making complex ideas more accessible and engaging. It includes:

- 📜 **Research Paper**: A document covering eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and their applications.
- 🐍 **Python Scripts**:
  - 📊 **Geometric Interpretation**: A visualization of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
  - 🌦️ **Weather Prediction**: Using Markov Chains to predict long-term weather distribution.

## 📂 Files
- **Research_Paper.txt**: Research paper on eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- **visual_example.py**: Python script for visualizing eigenvectors.
- **weather_forecast.py**: Python script for predicting weather using eigenvalues.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Before running the Python scripts, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. To install them, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔧 Key Libraries Used:
- 📏 **numpy** – For matrix computations
- 📊 **matplotlib** – For visualizing eigenvectors

## 🚀 Running the Scripts
### 1️⃣ Geometric Visualization
To see the eigenvector transformation visually, run:

```sh
python visual_example.py
```

This script generates a visual representation of how eigenvectors behave under linear transformation.

### 2️⃣ Weather Prediction
To simulate weather prediction based on Markov Chains, run:

```sh
python weather_forecast.py
```

This script will generate a weather forecast over multiple days and compare results with eigenvector calculations.

## 📌 Notes
- ⚠️ Ensure all required libraries are installed before running the scripts.
- 🖥️ The visual explanation script is best viewed with graphical output enabled.

Enjoy exploring the world of eigenvalues and eigenvectors! 🚀
